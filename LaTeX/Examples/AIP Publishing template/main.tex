\begin{abstract}
An article usually includes an abstract, a concise summary of the work
covered at length in the main body of the article. It is used for
secondary publications and for information retrieval purposes. 
\end{abstract}

\maketitle

\begin{quotation}
The ``lead paragraph'' is encapsulated with the \LaTeX\ 
\verb+quotation+ environment and is formatted as a single paragraph before the first section heading. 
(The \verb+quotation+ environment reverts to its usual meaning after the first sectioning command.) 
Note that numbered references are allowed in the lead paragraph.
%
The lead paragraph will only be found in an article being prepared for the journal \textit{Chaos}.
